                <p>I have worked every position in a restaurant from dishwasher to general manager.  I worked as a research analyst for the attorney who took down big tobacco.  I built a quality control and inventory management system from the ground up for Audix USA, producer of microphones for every room from the boardroom to concert halls.  I inspected titanium-cast aircraft and military components for Precision Castparts.</p>
