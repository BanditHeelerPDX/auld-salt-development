## Installation

I haven't made it a PWA yet, but I might. For now just dip on over and view it at the link above.

## Usage

To demonstrate all of the self-taught knowledge that I have gained over the last five and a half months. Checkout node.js and react.js and MongoDB and express and all of the deprecated libraries along the way.

@ me from your favorite position or opt for snail mail or if you're feeling squirrelly, drop a message in a bottle in the Willamette.

## Tests

Standardized testing is not advised - as a 99th percentile who never found himself in the 1%, it all seems to be mostly bullshit.

## Questions

Message in a bottle, chalk marks on public landmarks that lead to dead drops and if you're feeling lazy, I guess you can email me.
